# Detox_Learning

Overview of Detox
Detox is an open-source end-to-end (E2E) testing framework for React Native mobile applications. Our main goal is to enable the testing of any end-to-end flow in the app, with maximum velocity and zero flakiness. Detox tests your mobile app while it's running on a real device or simulator, simulating a real user's interactions.

Gray box testing
One of the most challenging aspects of automated testing on mobile is end-to-end testing. UI testing frameworks are often not fully-deterministic, since they are built with a "black box" approach, where the test runner has no access to the internals of the app under test, and is unaware of asynchronous operations that take place in the app (such as network requests, animations, etc.). This makes it difficult to write reliable E2E tests, and often leads to flaky tests that are hard to debug and maintain.


# Setup for my windows machine
Install chocolatey- Refer to https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/setup

npm install detox-cli --global

Out of the box, Detox offers you a first-class integration with Jest, the most popular testing framework for React Native. That's why your first step will be to install or update Jest in your project.

npm install "jest@^29" --save-dev

The command above will install the latest supported Jest version. The @^29 override is recommended in the first place to prevent you from getting an outdated Jest version unknowingly, under the influence of package lock files. For example, in React Native boilerplate projects, the package-lock.json is apt to restrict npm install jest to installing an older, unsupported version 26.x.

Now it's time to install Detox itself:

npm install detox --save-dev

Now, when all the dependencies are installed, initialize Detox in your project:

detox init
